		<h3> <i> Makki also known as corn or maize is widely used in Rajasthan during winter or rainy seasons. I personally like makki ki raab - a warm yogurt beverage which tastes heavenly during winter and makki ka kheech -a spicy preparation with onions, garlic and spices of your choice. For these recipes, we require not the corn itself but a more smaller, cleaner version of corn known as kheech. Same is available for wheat grains as well. We can obtain kheech at Indian grocery stores. I prefer getting the traditional stuff from India.</i></h3>
		<p>Makki Masala Kheech is one of the variations of the spicy kheech preparation. My mum in law made it and the taste is just amazing. You can have it for any meal but make sure to drink enough water afterwards.</p>
		<p>You will need following indegredients: Makki Kheech, Water, Salt, Crushed Garlic, Chopped Green Chillies, Gram Flour (Besan), Mustard Seeds, Asafoetida (Heeng), Red Chilly Powder, Roasted Cumin Powder (Jeera), Turmeric Powder, Chopped Coriander leaves and Oil</p>
		<p> You need to follow the below instructions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Soak the kheech overnight (~8 hours). In the morning pressure cook them with almost double water for about 8-10 whistles.</li>
			<li>Make sure that kheech is cooked and soft. It should appear starchy.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
			<li>Add asafoetida, crushed garlic and chopped green chillies and sauté it a little bit.</li>
			<li>Add besan  to this and sauté it on low medium heat till it turns golden brown and gives a nice aroma. Do not overcook it.</li>
			<li>Just as you smell the cooked besan, add spices like red chilli, roasted cumin and turmeric powder to it and sauté for just a little longer.</li>
			<li>At this point, add the starchy kheech to this mixture and mix well. [Secret: Remove excess water from kheech, just keep little bit so that its not dry. This helps to keep the dish a little crispy].</li>
			<li>Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve warm.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This dish can be enjoyed as is or with Kadhi (a spicy yogurt curry) or with chopped onion and lemon. In any way, the taste is absolutely delicious. Let me know how it turns out. Happy eating!! :-)</p>
